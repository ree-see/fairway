# Focused Round Mode Features

## Overview
This branch introduces a focused, distraction-free round mode experience for golfers, featuring a floating action button (FAB) menu and iOS Dynamic Island integration.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Floating Action Button (FAB) Menu
- **Position**: Bottom-right corner of the screen
- **Design**: Circular green button with shadow/elevation
- **Icon**: Three vertical dots (⋮)
- **Size**: 56x56px (Material Design standard)

### 2. Round Menu Modal
Slide-up modal with the following options:
- **Continue Round** - Close menu and continue
- **Pause Round** - Save progress (placeholder functionality)
- **Round Settings** - Access round configuration (placeholder)
- **View Summary** - Quick stats and hole completion
- **End Round** - Submit round (only when 9 or 18 holes complete)
- **Exit Without Saving** - Exit with confirmation dialog

### 3. iOS Dynamic Island Integration
- **Service**: `LiveActivityService.ts` handles Live Activities
- **Compact View**: Shows current score to par (e.g., "+2", "E", "-1")
- **Expanded View**: Shows "Hole 7/18 | +2 | 2:15"
- **Updates**: Real-time updates when strokes are entered
- **Cleanup**: Automatically ends when round is submitted

### 4. Enhanced Submit Button Logic
- Only displays when exactly 9 or 18 holes are completed
- Shows confirmation dialog for 9-hole rounds
- Automatic submission for 18-hole rounds

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/screens/ScorecardScreen.tsx` - Main implementation
- `src/services/LiveActivityService.ts` - New service for iOS integration
- `app.json` - Added Live Activity permissions

### Key Changes
1. Added FAB with modal menu
2. Integrated Live Activity updates on score changes
3. Enhanced hole completion checking
4. iOS-specific Dynamic Island support

### iOS Configuration
```json
"infoPlist": {
  "NSSupportsLiveActivities": true,
  "NSSupportsLiveActivitiesFrequentUpdates": true
}
```

## Usage

### FAB Menu
- Tap the floating button in the bottom-right corner
- Select desired action from the slide-up menu
- Tap outside modal or "Continue Round" to close

### Dynamic Island (iOS 16.1+)
- Automatically starts when round begins
- Updates in real-time as scores are entered
- Shows compact score in Dynamic Island
- Tap to return to app from Dynamic Island
- Ends automatically when round is submitted

### Submit Button
- Appears only when 9 or 18 holes are completed
- 9-hole rounds require confirmation
- 18-hole rounds submit immediately

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
1. **Swipe Navigation** - Left/right swipe between holes
2. **Auto-advance** - Move to next hole after score entry
3. **Visual Progress** - Hole completion indicator
4. **Haptic Feedback** - Touch feedback on interactions
5. **Pause/Resume** - Full round pause functionality
6. **Round Settings** - Mid-round configuration changes

### Native iOS Module
To fully implement Live Activities, a native iOS module would be needed:
```swift
// iOS ActivityKit integration
import ActivityKit

@available(iOS 16.1, *)
struct RoundActivityAttributes: ActivityAttributes {
    struct ContentState: Codable, Hashable {
        let currentHole: Int
        let scoreToPar: Int
        let elapsedTime: String
    }
    
    let courseName: String
}
```

## Testing
- FAB menu functionality: ✅
- Modal interactions: ✅  
- Submit button logic: ✅
- Live Activity service: ✅ (logging only)
- TypeScript compilation: ⚠️ (minor existing issues)

## Notes
- Live Activity currently uses console logging (needs native module for production)
- Some existing TypeScript issues in test files (unrelated to new features)
- FAB positioning accounts for iOS safe area
- Modal includes proper Android back button handling
